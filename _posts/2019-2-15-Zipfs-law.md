title: Zipf’s Law, or I am Bored on a Saturday

Wikipedia says, “Zipf’s law is an empirical law formulated using mathematical statistics that refers to the fact that many types of data studied in the physical and social sciences can be approximated with a Zipfian distribution, one of a family of related discrete power law probability distributions”.

See the formula here:

Wait, this is a blog post on a website whose purpose is to proofread for non-native English speakers; what the hell is this?! Ok, ok… let’s start over. Zipf’s law is pretty interesting when you look at the way it plays out in the distribution of words in a spoken language. According to Michael from the popular YouTube series “vsauce”, in the English language, the word “the” is the most encountered word! In fact, it occurs about every 16 words. Actually, if you go back to the beginning of this post, you’ll see Zipf’s law play out in real life – we only get 16 words into this thing and you’ll see the word the right from the get-go. Of course the list goes on, in ranked order from appearing most often to least we have: the, of, and, to, a, in, is, that, I, it, for, you, was, with, on, as, have, but, be, and they. This brings us back to the math bit of this whole thing. As you rank the appearance of the words, a pattern begins to emerge. Beginning with the most frequently occurring all the way to the least, you will find that the second most used word appears half of often as the first, and the third about a third, and the fourth about a fourth – it continues like that all the way down. 

You may still be asking yourself, “what does this have to do with proofreading?” An interesting point I found, and it’s practical, unlike these other thoughts which amount to mostly just party trivia, is that some languages do not have the articles the and a. Russian, for example, has no need for such things. Do you see where I am going with this? The most popular word in English is a word often neglected by native Russian speakers (because it’s not natural to include it) who need to communicate with an English speaking audience. A word which can be found so often surely can’t be left out! It is very important that any person who wishes to speak as a native, and who must communicate either professionally or who would like to have the maximum impact when speaking, must not forget to include such pivotal words in the English language. 

In closing, I hope that you can begin to appreciate the importance of what seem to be such minor words at first glance. Whether you find the math behind this law elegant or annoying, you might see the sheer practicality of it and how it explains the distribution of words. And if you don’t, hey, that’s ok too! Sometimes it’s easier to sit back, relax, and let someone else worry about these things. Professional proofreading services such as socialtrellis are all about that – allowing you to sit back and relax while our team of experts worries about discrete power law probability distributions and how they predict how often a given word appears in the English language.
