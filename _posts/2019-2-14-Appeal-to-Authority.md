It was 2:00 P.M. on a Saturday afternoon and I was having a quiet moment of thought. I was thinking about what might drive one person to listen to another. I remembered I had this poster which explained, in a fun way, the different logical fallacies, that is to say, ways that people try to argue a point. For example, person A is an expert on issue 1, says issue 1 is false. Therefore, issue 1 is false. People tend to believe this person because they have advanced degrees, or a certification and that helps build their authority on the subject. What’s the catch? Well, in order for a claim to be supported, there should be evidence. The fact that someone is an expert can’t be the only reason they are to be trusted. The problem is, most people assume information coming from an authority to be true. 

This led me to my next thought, when I communicate with someone, why do they choose to give me credibility? Is it the manner in which I speak? Is it because my writing is clear, concise, and free of errors? Is it fair to assume that someone should be given less credibility because they have poor grammer or spelling? No, probably not – but unfortunately that is just how things tend to be. So, in my opinion, to have the greatest impact on an audience, one should strive to have the best communication skills possible. This isn’t always going to come easily. After all, if everyone could spell perfectly all the time nobody would have invented autocorrect, would they?

Luckily, there are those out there who have dedicated themselves to helping others. There are book editors, proofreaders, and other individuals who spend their time making sure only the best product is delivered. One such company is socialtrellis, a company who strives to make every sentence powerful. Whose goal is to make sure that your words come across just the way you intended, but with all the corrections effortlessly applied so that you can provide only the best to your audience, your boss, or your customers. 

Oh, by the way, did you notice I spelled “grammar” wrong in the second paragraph?

After saying all of that, why would someone choose to trust you? When you communicate professionally, you might not always have time to provide statistics or evidence. However, when your correspondence is spelled correctly and has good grammar, you are well on your way to making the best impact and getting your point across – and that is the foundation of trust and powerful way to make an excellent first impression.
