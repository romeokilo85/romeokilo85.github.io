When you set out to express yourself through writing, you must strive to communicate your thoughts clearly to the audience. That is one of the main goals in writing, after all; to express yourself through your written words. The reader, in turn, is able to clearly understand what you have set out to say and can easily digest the material. That is to say, they can come to appreciate your viewpoint or opinion on a matter. If someone is reading something but becoming lost, confused, or distracted by the words you took time to put on paper (or screen), then what is the point in even spending time writing it down? To maximize your credibility or reputation as a writer, you must put in the effort and time to effectively communicate. This is an important point because whether you are writing to a colleague or a superior, or even just a social media post, you should want to be taken seriously.  That being said, let’s discuss some common mistakes. 

1. Subject-verb agreement is vitally important! For instance, let’s say you like cars. You wouldn’t want to say, “Cars has been an important part of my life”. The problem here is that “cars” is plural and life is singular. The correct way to say this is, “Cars have been an important part of my life”.

2. Another easy mistake to make is forgetting to add a comma after an introductory element. For instance, you will want to add a comma after introducing something. See what I did there? 

3. Moving right along, it’s imperative that you add an apostrophe to the word “it’s” when you intend to say “it is”. If you forego the apostrophe, you are implying that the object belongs to something. An example would be, “The dog was licking its paw” – the incorrect way would be: “The dog was licking it’s paw”.

4. The following is one of my greatest pet peeves; Vague pronoun reference. Have you ever been discussing something with a friend or coworker and they don’t say who exactly they are talking about? It could go something like this, “When my mom found the store clerk, she was so happy!” Can you easily tell who is happy? This can be avoided by saying, “My mom was happy to find the store clerk”.

5. Finally, I will end with a mistake that is very common and easy to avoid; the run-on sentence. Here is an example of one: My dog tried to escape through the front door but I was able to stop her. The best way to say this is: “My dog tried to escape through the front door, but I was able to stop her”. See how much a simple comma can clear things up?
This is in no way meant to be an exhaustive list of mistakes, just a few which came to mind. When writing, you have to keep the audience in mind and try to be as clear as possible. This is the best way to not only clearly communicate, but a guaranteed way to keep your credibility as an author high. If you start to lose credibility, it can be very difficult to reclaim.
